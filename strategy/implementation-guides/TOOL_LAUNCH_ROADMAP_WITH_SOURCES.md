   - YES → Continue, add premium features
   - NO → Kill it, try next tool

2. **Are users giving positive feedback?**
   - YES → Double marketing spend
   - NO → Pivot the tool or kill it

3. **Is churn <5%/month?**
   - YES → It's sticky, keep it
   - NO → Improve product quickly

**Success rule:** Keep top 3-4 performers, retire the rest
