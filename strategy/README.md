## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE

### Your Situation
```
Location: Bangalore, India
Job: 10-7 solo designer at SaaS (₹53K/month)
Available time: 7pm-11pm + weekends (20 hours/week)
Constraint: Indians are price-sensitive
Advantage: You're a designer + product thinker
```

### Your Path
```
Week 1-3:   Build GST Auditor (Tool #1) → ₹15-30K/month
Week 4-6:   Build Income Tax Auditor (Tool #2) → +₹20-40K/month
Week 7-9:   Rebrand Labour Code (Tool #3) → +₹10K/month
Week 10-12: Build DPDP Privacy (Tool #4) → +₹15-25K/month

By end of Month 3: ₹60-100K/month (more than your job!)
```

### What Makes This Work In India
```
✅ Mandatory compliance = hard to say no (GST, Income Tax, DPDP)
✅ Sell to CA firms @ ₹15K/month (not individuals @ ₹999/month)
✅ CA firms resell to clients (they handle distribution)
✅ Low churn (5%/year vs 50%/month for individual subscriptions)
✅ Your design skills = 5x higher pricing power
✅ Part-time sustainable (4 hours/day)
```

## 🎯 YOUR DECISION FRAMEWORK

**Which path should you take?**

**India-focused** (RECOMMENDED for you)
- ✅ You're in India
- ✅ You understand the market
- ✅ Better revenue (B2B2C model)
- ✅ Lower churn (corporate customers)
- ✅ Your design skills matter more
- **Revenue trajectory:** ₹60-100K/month by month 3

**Global** (if you want worldwide reach)
- ✅ Larger total addressable market
- ✅ Higher individual pricing possible
- ❌ Harder to reach customers (PPC, ads, influencers)
- ❌ Higher churn (individual subscriptions)
- ❌ More competition
- **Revenue trajectory:** Slower but potentially larger long-term

**My recommendation:** Start with India-specific. Build 4-5 hit tools there. Then expand globally with your proven model.
